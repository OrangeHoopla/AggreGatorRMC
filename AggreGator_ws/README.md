#Workspace

This is the ROS workspace for all of the packages.

------------------------------------------------

##Compilation Notice

Due to the interpackage dependencies and our current CMakeList setup, the workspace must be `catkin_make`'d several times, until the dependencies are generated.
<br>
The source of this is likely due to the lack of dependency exporting in the `motor_controller` package.

###third_party_pkgs
This contains all third party packages used in our system. They were all obtained from their source repositories and are included to reduce the need to download the packages on whatever development board we use.
