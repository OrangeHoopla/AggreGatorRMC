git status 		//tells you what you're about to add
git commit -m "appropriate message about yo code"
git push 		//officially puts it into the repository

// delete some stuff from the repository

git add -u 		//prepares to delete what you just deleted
git status 		//tells you what you're about to delete
git push 		//officially deletes
